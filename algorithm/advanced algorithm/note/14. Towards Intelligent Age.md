# Towards Intellignet Age - Role of Algorithm

Outline
1. How to Write a Good Code
2. What is the First Step?


## 1. How to Write a Good Code
- How to solve a problem by C/C++?
- How to optimize?

## 2. What is the First Step?

1. How to divide problem?
  - Header & Source

2. Frameworks
  - How to build your functions for solving a given problem?
  - Set the types of input and output

3. Define global arrays

4. Define local variables
5. Define local memory

6. Focus on the memory state

## 3. What is the Final step
1. Polish your code
   - naming of your variables and arrays: provide the semantic meaning for readability
   - keep in a line: make your code clearly(readability)
   - using #ifdef, #endif rather tha comments: prevent yielding logical errors in your code
     - **select mode!**
   - using a structure(or class) for representing multiple concepts
     - vertor & list ...

2. Optimize code
   - Algorithm Optimization
     - delete useless calculation
     - delete useless loop
   - Code Optimization: depends on your coding skills
     - change algorithm structure
